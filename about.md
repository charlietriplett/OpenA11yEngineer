## History

A11yEngineer is an open source collaboration started by User1st and T-Mobile.

## Philosophy

- A11yEngineer takes the view that code should be semantic and standards compliant first. 
- Compliant code shouldn't be hacked to accommodate screen readers that don't support standard HTML features

## How to contribute
- Record a video in a screen reader we don't have covered
- Fix a typo (there are definitely some) or edit for consistent style
