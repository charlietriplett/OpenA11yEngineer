## About headings

Headings should be logically ordered starting with a single `<h1>`. On this page, the title is the `<h1>`.

## How headings are used

There are common 3 ways screenreaders interact with headings.

### Browse mode

Screenreaders can simply read the entire page item by item.

### Shortcuts / quick keys

Screenreaders can skip from heading to heading

### Rotor / list

Screenreaders can gather all headings into a single list to choose from.

## Headings should be in logical order

Starting with a singular unique `<h1>`, the outline of the page should be apparent from just the headings.

Use `<h2>` as a heading for major sections.

Subsections should be an `<h3>`.

(It should be rare that `<h4>` or `<h5>` will be used.)

## Why headings matter

Headings give the page structure and meaning to both the screen reader user and for search engines like Google.
