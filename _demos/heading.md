## About headings

Headings should be logically ordered starting with a single `<h1>`.

Use `<h2>` as a heading for major sections.

Subsections should be an `<h3>`.

It should be rare that `<h4>` or `<h5>` will be used.

## Why headings matter

Headings give the page structure and meaning to both the screen reader user and for search engines like Google.

## How headings are used

There are 3 ways screenreaders interact with headings:

### Shortcuts / quick keys

Screenreaders can skip from heading to heading

### Rotor / list

Screenreaders can gather all headings into a single list to choose from.

### Browse mode

Screenreaders can simply read the entire page item by item.
