A link takes the user to a different [URI](https://www.w3.org/Addressing/), is [focusable](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-visible.html) and identifies its [role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.0/roles#link) as a link. 

See the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) for strategies, standards, resources to make the Web accessible to people with disabilities.
